While the bee is within your space, you can speak its command word and expend up to 3 of its charges as a bonus action to command the bee to heal a creature that you can see within 20 feet of you. The bee flies to the creature's space and touches its stinger to the creature, emitting a bright light that fills the bee's space and healing the creature for 1d6 hit points for each expended charge. After healing the creature, the bee returns to your space.\n\nThe bee is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has AC 15, 10 hit points, and has resistance to all damage types. If the mending spell is cast on the bee while it has at least 1 hit point, it regains 2d6 hit points. If the bee drops to 0 hit points, it can't be used again for 24 hours, at which point it regains all its hit points.\n\n\nNo matter the struggle, no matter who won or lost, the Keepers would always be there to pick up the pieces.

A creature takes 1d6 acid damage when it's restrained by the net and again at the end of each of its turns it remains restrained. If the creature is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers whenever it takes acid damage at the end of one of its turns. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. A creature other than you who touches the net takes 1d6 acid damage.\n\nThe net's sticky composition makes it more difficult to escape than a mundane one. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has resistance to all damage types. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and tearing the net apart.\n\nThe torn net is harmless.

Its origins beyond that are entirely unknown, with some suggesting it was made by the plane itself rather than forged or crafted by a mere creature's hands. Attuning to the staff bestows some of its planar powers to you, allowing you to breathe underwater and ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment. In addition, while holding the staff, you have resistance to cold damage.\n\nThis staff has 15 charges which are used to power its various properties. The staff regains 1d8 + 7 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nState Change. The staff has a powerful control over the various states of water. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the staff's ever-present bounty of water to change its state into a gas, liquid, or solid. The properties of each state are listed below. Alternatively, you can expend 1 charge as a reaction when you are the target of an attack or spell to force the staff to change its state more rapidly. When you do, the staff's change is immediate: potentially affecting the outcome of the incoming attack or spell. You take this reaction when you know you are the target of the attack or spell, but before knowing the result of the roll.\n\nGas. When the staff enters its gaseous state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a fine mist. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties:\n\n    You are resistant to bludgeoning and piercing damage.\n\n    Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet.\n\n    You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.\n\n    You can pass through a hostile creature's space without reducing your movement speed. • Attacks of opportunity against you are made with disadvantage.\n\nGas Spells. While holding the staff in its gas state, you can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges on your turn to cast the following spells from it: cloudkill (5 charges), fog cloud (1 charge), gaseous form (3 charges), misty step (2 charges), or wind walk (6 charges).\n\nTailwind. While holding the staff in its gas state, you can expend 2 charges and speak the staff's command word as an action to grant additional powers to you and nearby allies. Until the end of your next turn, you and friendly creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you can take the Dash action as a bonus action and don't provoke opportunity attacks by moving.\n\nLiquid. When the staff enters its liquid state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a swirling torrent. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties:\n\n    You are resistant to bludgeoning and slashing damage.\n\n    Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet.\n\n    You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\n\n    You can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground.\n\n    When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\n\nLiquid Spells. While holding the staff in its liquid state, you can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges on your turn to cast the following spells from it: blur (2 charges), control water (4 charges), create or destroy water (1 charge), mirror image (2 charges), or water breathing (3 charges).\n\nTide Turner. While holding the staff in its liquid state, you can expend 3 charges and speak the staff's command word as an action to send out a wave of ethereal magic water to buffet and push your enemies. Hostile creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you are forced to make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed either 20 feet toward you or away from you (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much bludgeoning damage and is not pushed.\n\nSolid. When the staff enters its solid state, the water surrounding the staff becomes a frozen shell. While holding the staff in this state, you gain the following properties:\n\n    You are resistant to piercing and slashing damage.\n\n    Your movement speed is reduced to 5 feet.\n\n    You gain a +3 bonus to AC.\n\n    If you're pushed against your will, the distance you are pushed is halved.\n\n    You gain 10 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns that last until the staff changes state.\n\nSolid Spells. While holding the staff in its solid state, you can expend some of the staff's charges on your turn to cast the following spells from it (save DC 18): cone of cold (5 charges), ice storm (4 charges), ray of frost (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +10 to hit with ranged spell attack), wall of ice (6 charges).\n\nDeep Freeze. While holding the staff in its solid state, you can expend 4 charges and speak the staff's command word as an action to send out a chilling blast to freeze your enemies. Hostile creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you are forced to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is halved instead.\n\nRandom Properties. Precipit, the Formless has the following random properties:\n\n    2 minor beneficial properties.\n\n    2 minor detrimental properties.\n\nDestroying the Staff. The only way to destroy the staff is to keep it untouched by water for one hundred years while on the Elemental Plane of Water, at which point it crumbles to dust. Any amount, such as a puff of misty air, a drip of water, or the touch of ice during that time reinvigorates the staff's bounty of water.\n\n\nThe sea is a vessel for life, for time, and for change.

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, two flaming wings unfurl from your back and carry you to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away from you without provoking opportunity attacks. Once this property of the helm has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.

The only way to destroy the helmet is to feed it to an ancient phoenix. The phoenix dies and is immediately reborn as a result of the intense magic stored within the artifact. When it's reborn, the phoenix has a pronounced crown of golden feathers upon its head. Regardless of how many times it's reborn, the phoenix retains this crown of feathers.\n\n\nThe soul of fire was never so brightly manifested in any as it was in Fara. Where she walked, her men had the fortitude and bravery of titans. Where she fought, her foes fell like reeds to a flame.

When planted, the stem breaks off in your hand. While you're attuned to the seed, the stem magically remains on your person at all times.\n\nOnce fully grown, the spire tree is 300 feet tall with a 20-foot radius. It tapers gently inward towards the top of the tree. At the base of this magic tree is a door large enough for Medium creatures to enter. The door is guarded by a dryad who is loyal to you and any creature you choose. The dryad accepts the seed's stem as proof of ownership and uses it as a key to open the door. Once opened, your attunement to the seed ends, the tree belongs to you, and both you and other allies you designate to the dryad can enter and leave the tree at will. Your attunement to the seed does not end if you are more than 100 feet away from it, and can only be ended early by a wish spell.

The pylons are tipped with a fragment of a blue dragon's horn.

Each pylon has an electrical charge. Once that charge has been lost, It takes 12 hours for it to recharge.\n\nYou can set up a pylon in an unoccupied space adjacent to you as an action. While touching a set up pylon that has an electrical charge, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to electrify it.

On a failure, a creature takes 5d8 lightning damage and has its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and has its speed halved instead.

A creature that touches an electrified pylon or hits it with a melee attack using a metal weapon takes 1d8 lightning damage for each pylon connected to it, including itself.

Placing the beetle on a piece of parchment you hold or carry causes it to spring to life and begin tracking your travels. As you move, so does the beetle. It leaves behind a small line of ink that it generates. The ink immediately dries and doesn't dissolve in water. In addition. the beetle's small frame allows it to move even while enclosed in a book or similar enclosure without losing its sense of movement or direction.\n\nThe beetle has a dial on its underside. A creature can use the dial to select the scale in which the beetle moves. For each option, the beetle moves 1 inch in the same direction as you for every amount you move as shown on the dial, creating a map of your journey: 20 feet, 200 feet, 2 miles, or 20 miles. The beetle is immune to magical effects that would otherwise alter its sense of direction.\n\nThe beetle always knows which direction is North. When placed on a piece of parchment for the first time, it crouches down to stamp a small compass rose on the sheet before beginning to move. If the beetle runs out of space on the parchment to travel, it stops moving in that direction and emits a clicking sound that can be heard by creatures within 5 feet of it.\n\nAttaching one band of the found and lost to the beetle while you wear the other allows the beetle to move and trace your movements in this way from afar so long as you are both on the same place of existence.\n\n\nThe Cartographer's Guild of Antronec would hire small bands of adventurers to test their mettle on new and exciting expeditions provided they wear a single band of the found and lost. \"To make sure you're alright!\" they would say, with a smile. They always had the best smiles. Besides, the gold was always worth the request.\n\nIn an enclosed room, well-guarded and hidden in the basement of the guild, the Cartographers would watch in earnest as these beetles would scurry across sheets of labeled parchment as bands of expendable mercenaries would plot the best—and worst—routes through the most dangerous places in the realm. Some maps were sold to the highest bidder. Others were used by Cartographers themselves to ransack the remains of their fallen hires and finish the job themselves.","item_id":159,"item_name":"Clockwork Inkbeetle","item_pic":"https://i.redd.it/h6b8t3cq3zz21.png","item_rarity":"uncommon","item_source":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGriffonsSaddlebag/","item_type":"Wondrous item"},{"item_description":"These weapons are made of a dense iron and have the heavy property.

This powerful ring is made of an enchanted gold blessed by a god of life and healing. While you are attuned to the ring and are wearing it, you can use your Lay On Hands ability on an ally within 10 feet of you instead of needing to touch them.\n\nThe Outer Ring. The inner, golden ring has a second silver puzzle ring encircling it. The silver puzzle ring is made of three powerfully enchanted bands that, when fit together in an elaborate and ever-changing puzzle, cause you to emanate a 30-foot aura that heals and supports your allies. As an action, you can make an Intelligence check to try and solve one of the three puzzles in a fixed order.\n\n    The first band slides into place following a successful DC 5 Intelligence check. Once solved, you begin to emit the ring's aura. The aura lasts for 1 minute and is always centered on you. While you emit this aura, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause a creature within the aura (including you) to regain 2d6 hit points.\n\n    The second band is solved following a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. When it slides into place, the aura's strength increases. Nonhostile, living creatures in the aura that start their turn with 0 hit points immediately regain 1 hit point. In addition, creatures within the radius have resistance against necrotic damage, and their hit point maximum can't be reduced.\n\n    The third and final band is solved following a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. When the band fits into place to complete the puzzle, the aura's power is maximized. Allied creatures within the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects, and if succeeding on a saving throw in this way would normally cause the allied creature to take half damage, they take no damage instead.\n\nThe aura ends early if you take off the ring or fall unconscious. Once the effects end, you cannot activate the outer ring again until 1 day has passed for each band that you solved. If you solve all 3 bands to complete the puzzle ring, you can reduce the number of days you need to wait by 1d3. On a 3, you can dismantle and begin to reassemble the puzzle ring immediately after the aura fades.\n\n\n\"The mystery of life is convoluted. Ever changing. No two people or moments are the same.
