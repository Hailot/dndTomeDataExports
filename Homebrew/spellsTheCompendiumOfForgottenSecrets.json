You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren’t filled with difficult terrain with murals, runes, scratchings, etchings, or other sigils. A creature that steps on a sigil takes 1d6 damage of a type fitting to the Alrisen patron, as the defensive magic unleashes scorching fire, chilling ocean water, radiant energy, or the cruel necrotic power of the grave. To a creature immune to this effect, the inscriptions whisper in eerie voices or recount the stories of heroes from distant worlds. \n• Eldritch Servants. You can call forth up to eight servants from the Alrisen whose token you’ve used to cast the spell. These servants are the potential familiars listed for warlocks who’ve chosen the Pact of the Chain feature, or other creatures with a CR of 1 or lower.

If you don’t give them commands and no intruders are present, the servants do nothing other than patrol and dwell within the lair. The servants can’t leave the otherworldly lair. When the spell ends, they disappear. \n• Deadly Trap. Choose one spell that you can cast with a duration of “Instantaneous” that deals damage and has a casting time of one action or bonus action. You can decide on a trap that will cause the spell to be cast, triggering when a creature takes an action that you specify when you create the lair, such as touching a certain object or speaking a certain phrase.

The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they fall in and are immediately dragged 60 feet down by a fierce current. They begin to drown, and must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of their turns. Each turn that they fail, they gain one level of exhaustion. A creature cannot move normally while in this abyss. Instead, they must use their action to attempt to ascend. The creature must make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If they succeed, they swim 20 feet towards the surface. If they reach the surface or you lose concentration on the spell, the spell ends and they are ejected prone at the point they departed from. If they die, they do not return."
