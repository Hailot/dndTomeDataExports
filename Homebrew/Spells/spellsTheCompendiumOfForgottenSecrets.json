You can decide on a trap that will cause the spell to be cast, triggering when a creature takes an action that you specify when you create the lair, such as touching a certain object or speaking a certain phrase.

The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they fall in and are immediately dragged 60 feet down by a fierce current. They begin to drown, and must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of their turns. Each turn that they fail, they gain one level of exhaustion. A creature cannot move normally while in this abyss. Instead, they must use their action to attempt to ascend. The creature must make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. If they succeed, they swim 20 feet towards the surface. If they reach the surface or you lose concentration on the spell, the spell ends and they are ejected prone at the point they departed from. If they die, they do not return."
