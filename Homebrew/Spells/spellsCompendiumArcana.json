Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small, perfectly crafted mithril orb.\\n\tHedged Prison: The spell transports the target into a demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\\n\tMinimus Containment: The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The caster of the spell can use an action and allow the creature(s) inside the gemstone to communicate telepathically with any creature within 5 feet. The special component for this version of the spell is a transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\\n\tSlumber: The target becomes catatonic and cannot be woken. Creatures not normally affected by sleep are still affected by this. The special component for this version of the spell is a rare combination of herbs.\\n\tEnding the Spell: During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the targets. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.

That creature must make a Constitution saving throw when you first cast this spell, and at the end of each of its turns while you concentrate on it. If it ever fails this saving throw, the spell ends, and the creature is cursed with Soulblight. This curse can only be removed by a greater restoration spell cast using a 9th-level spell slot, or a wish spell. While a creature is cursed, it gains the following effects:\\n\tEvery time the creature finishes a long rest, its' Constitution score is reduced by 1. Every time a creature not cursed with Soulblight spends 1 hour within 30 feet of one that is, it must make a Constitution saving throw or become cursed as well. This effect ignores total cover and penetrates magical barriers and defenses created by spells of 8th level or lower.\\n\tFinally, any creature that dies while affected by this curse reanimates as a zombie under your command after 24 hours. These creatures obey your orders to the best of their abilities. If you give them no orders, they will wander and attempt to kill other living creatures they come across. Whenever a zombie comes into physical contact with a creature not cursed with Soulblight (usually by making an attack), that creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become cursed as well. A creature killed by these zombies animates after 24 hours as if it died while cursed.\\n",

It seems completely real, and can include sounds, smells, temperature, and other sensations appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).\\n\tThe illusion is not physical, however it can invoke tactile sensations, such as a gentle breeze, rough bark, or a prickling as if one was being watched. It can even emulate arcane sensations, such as the auras seen when using detect magic. The illusion can appear to move and emulate different sensations within itself, such as if you create the illusion of a town, complete with people walking and talking as the smells of a market waft through the air.\\n\tAs long as you can see the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot you can see. As it changes location, you can alter it so that its movement seems natural for the illusion. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\\n\tPhysical interaction with the illusion may reveal it to be an illusion, because although it can invoke tactile sensations, things can still pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an Illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the Illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\\n",
