Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\n\n", "monster_lAbtl": "", "monster_speed": "walk: 30, fly: 90, "}, {"monster_name": "Dogmole", "monster_size": "Medium", "monster_type": "beast", "monster_subtype": "", "monster_cr": "1", "monster_alignment": "neutral", "monster_armorClass": 14, "monster_hitPoints": 71, "monster_strength": 14, "monster_dexterity": 17, "monster_constitution": 15, "monster_intelligence": 2, "monster_wisdom": 12, "monster_charisma": 10, "monster_dmgVulnerabilities": "", "monster_dmgResistance": "", "monster_dmgImmunities": "", "monster_conImmunities": "", "monster_senses": "blindsight 30 ft., passive Perception 11", "monster_lang": "-", "monster_source": "tob", "monster_id": 276, "monster_pic": "", "monster_savingThrows": "", "monster_ablt": "Multiattack: \nThe dogmole makes one claw attack and one bite attack.\n\nBite: \nMelee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell.

Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording.

The target of the drift (but not the future self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self doesn't reappear after using this ability the second time; only the target of the drift reappears from the second use.

A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\nHag Coven: \nWhen hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n\u2022 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n\u2022 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\u2022 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n\u2022 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n\u2022 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n\u2022 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n", "monster_lAbtl": "", "monster_speed": "walk: 30, "}, {"monster_name": "Green Knight of the Woods", "monster_size": "Medium", "monster_type": "fey", "monster_subtype": "", "monster_cr": "6", "monster_alignment": "lawful neutral", "monster_armorClass": 20, "monster_hitPoints": 78, "monster_strength": 18, "monster_dexterity": 10, "monster_constitution": 14, "monster_intelligence": 10, "monster_wisdom": 12, "monster_charisma": 16, "monster_dmgVulnerabilities": "", "monster_dmgResistance": "bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks not made with cold iron", "monster_dmgImmunities": "", "monster_conImmunities": "charmed, frightened", "monster_senses": "darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11", "monster_lang": "Common, Elvish, Sylvan", "monster_source": "cc", "monster_id": 471, "monster_pic": "", "monster_savingThrows": "Dexterity: 3  Constitution: 5  ", "monster_ablt": "Multiattack: \nThe green knight makes two attacks: one with its battle axe and one with its shield bash.\n\nBattle Axe: \nMelee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Mechuiti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nat will: dispel magic, fireball, hold monster, wall of fire\n\n3/day each: fire storm, power word stun\n\n1/day each: meteor swarm, power word kill\n\nSpeak with Apes: \nMechuiti can communicate simple concepts to apes.\n\nMechuiti's Lair: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mechuiti takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Mechuiti can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n\n- Mechuiti targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it, and a fissure full of lava opens under the target\u2019s feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) fire damage.\n\n- The whole volcano trembles and shakes. Each creature on a solid surface other than a demon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. All ground in the volcano becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than a demon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.\n\n- The pain of all creatures other than demons within 120 feet of Mechuiti is intensified. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, every time a creature affected this way takes damage, he must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing Mechuiti\u2019s lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects.\n\n- Mechuiti can make the volcano erupt at will. A cloud of hot ashes and smoke covers a 6 mile area around the volcano, and magma flows from the volcano\u2019s cone.\n\n- When intelligent creatures within 6 miles sleep, they dream with Mechuiti. Unless they make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, they are compelled to seek out and join Mechuiti\u2019s cult.\n\n- Water within 1 mile of the lair carries Mechuiti\u2019s Ichor disease. Any creature that drinks the water must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected. An infected creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.\n\nwhen Mechuiti dies, all these regional effects fade immediately.\n\n", "monster_lAbtl": "Move: \nMechuiti moves up to half its speed, using any move it wishes.\n\nBurn from Inside: \nMechuiti targets a creature within 120 feet that has Mechuiti's Ichor disease.

A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10).

The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).\n\nHag Coven: \nWhen hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n\u2022 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n\u2022 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\u2022 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n\u2022 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n\u2022 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n\u2022 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n", "monster_lAbtl": "", "monster_speed": "walk: 30, "}, {"monster_name": "Night Scorpion", "monster_size": "Large", "monster_type": "beast", "monster_subtype": "", "monster_cr": "3", "monster_alignment": "unaligned", "monster_armorClass": 14, "monster_hitPoints": 90, "monster_strength": 15, "monster_dexterity": 14, "monster_constitution": 14, "monster_intelligence": 1, "monster_wisdom": 9, "monster_charisma": 3, "monster_dmgVulnerabilities": "", "monster_dmgResistance": "", "monster_dmgImmunities": "", "monster_conImmunities": "", "monster_senses": "blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 9", "monster_lang": "-", "monster_source": "tob", "monster_id": 672, "monster_pic": "", "monster_savingThrows": "", "monster_ablt": "Multiattack: \nThe scorpion makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting.\n\nClaw: \nMelee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy becomes incapacitated. While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. A charmed target that is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The charmed creature doesn't maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A successful saving throw ends the effect on that creature and makes the creature immune to this harpy's song for 24 hours.\n\n", "monster_skills": "performance: 7, stealth: 6, ", "monster_sAblt": "Quiet Flight: \nThe owl harpy gains an additional +3 to Stealth (+9 in total) while flying.\n\nDissonance: \nThe owl harpy can't use its blindsight while deafened.\n\nInnate Spellcasting: \nthe owl harpy's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.\n\nHag Coven: \nWhen hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n\u2022 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n\u2022 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\u2022 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n\u2022 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n\u2022 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n\u2022 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n", "monster_lAbtl": "", "monster_speed": "walk: 30, swim: 40, "}, {"monster_name": "Sea Horse", "monster_size": "Tiny", "monster_type": "beast", "monster_subtype": "", "monster_cr": "0", "monster_alignment": "unaligned", "monster_armorClass": 11, "monster_hitPoints": 1, "monster_strength": 1, "monster_dexterity": 12, "monster_constitution": 8, "monster_intelligence": 1, "monster_wisdom": 10, "monster_charisma": 2, "monster_dmgVulnerabilities": "", "monster_dmgResistance": "", "monster_dmgImmunities": "", "monster_conImmunities": "", "monster_senses": "passive Perception 10", "monster_lang": "", "monster_source": "wotc-srd", "monster_id": 820, "monster_pic": "", "monster_savingThrows": "", "monster_ablt": "", "monster_skills": "", "monster_sAblt": "Water Breathing: \nThe sea horse can breathe only underwater.\n\n", "monster_lAbtl": "", "monster_speed": "swim: 20, "}, {"monster_name": "Selang", "monster_size": "Medium", "monster_type": "fey", "monster_subtype": "", "monster_cr": "4", "monster_alignment": "chaotic evil", "monster_armorClass": 15, "monster_hitPoints": 76, "monster_strength": 18, "monster_dexterity": 15, "monster_constitution": 18, "monster_intelligence": 12, "monster_wisdom": 14, "monster_charisma": 19, "monster_dmgVulnerabilities": "", "monster_dmgResistance": "bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons", "monster_dmgImmunities": "acid, lightning", "monster_conImmunities": "", "monster_senses": "darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 16", "monster_lang": "Common, Elvish, Sylvan, Void Speech", "monster_source": "tob", "monster_id": 821, "monster_pic": "", "monster_savingThrows": "Dexterity: 4  Constitution: 6  Charisma: 6  ", "monster_ablt": "Multiattack: \nThe selang makes two dagger attacks or two short bow attacks.\n\nDagger: \nMelee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.

If they died at or within one level of the prediction, they return to life with some useful insight into the destiny of someone important.\n\n", "monster_lAbtl": "", "monster_speed": "walk: 30, fly: 30, "}, {"monster_name": "Skeleton", "monster_size": "Medium", "monster_type": "undead", "monster_subtype": "", "monster_cr": "1/4", "monster_alignment": "lawful evil", "monster_armorClass": 13, "monster_hitPoints": 13, "monster_strength": 10, "monster_dexterity": 14, "monster_constitution": 15, "monster_intelligence": 6, "monster_wisdom": 8, "monster_charisma": 5, "monster_dmgVulnerabilities": "bludgeoning", "monster_dmgResistance": "", "monster_dmgImmunities": "", "monster_conImmunities": "poisoned", "monster_senses": "darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9", "monster_lang": "understands all languages it spoke in life but can't speak", "monster_source": "wotc-srd", "monster_id": 860, "monster_pic": "", "monster_savingThrows": "", "monster_ablt": "Shortsword: \nMelee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
