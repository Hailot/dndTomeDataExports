Weapons that hit the alnaar deal their damage before being destroyed. This trait is suppressed if the alnaar is starving.\n\nStarving Wrath: \nIf an alnaar hasn\u2019t fed on a Medium-sized or larger creature within the last 12 hours, it is starving. While starving, the alnaar\u2019s Armor Class is reduced by 2, it has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn\u2019t have all of its hp, and will direct its attacks at a single foe regardless of tactical consequences. Once it feeds on a Medium-sized or larger corpse or brings a Medium-sized or larger creature to 0 hp, it is no longer starving.\n\n",

The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing a legendary flame dragon\u2019s lair is warped by the dragon\u2019s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.\n\n- Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.\n\n- Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon\u2019s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they\u2019re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n\nif the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.\n\n",

A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\n**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\n\n",

Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the start of the rat's next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start of the rat's third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the original doppelrat's 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3 would become 12, and so on. Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat, can either move or take an action the round it appears, and has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish 1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the preexisting clones remain until their time expires. A creature can identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check.\n\nDoppeling Disease: \nAt the end of a dopplerat encounter, every creature bitten by a doppelrat or its duplicates must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the degenerate cloning disease. During each long rest, the diseased creature grows and sloughs off a stillborn clone. The doppeling process leaves the diseased creature incapacitated for 1 hour, unable to move and barely able to speak (spellcasting is impossible in this state). When the incapacitation wears off, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; it recovers from the disease when it makes its second successful save. Humanoid clones created by the disease cannot be brought to life in any manner.\n\n",

A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\n**Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\n\n",

The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\nThe possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\n\n",

A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\nHag Coven: \nWhen hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n\u2022 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n\u2022 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\u2022 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n\u2022 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n\u2022 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n\u2022 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n",

Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn't much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it's affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn't entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction. Under the wrong conditions, such as in a populated area, a hulking whelp's Unleashed Emotion can last for days.\n\n",

All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil.\n\n",

Foraging for food by hunting is difficult and only yields half the normal amount of food.\n\n- Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair.\n\n- Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair.

If Mechuiti scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times instead of twice.\n\nImmolating Breath (Recharge 5-6): \nMechuiti exhales fire and acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that cone takes 21 (6d6) fire damage plus 21 (6d6) acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC 24 Dexterity saving throw.\n\nImmolating Corona: \nMechuiti's fiery crown explodes into a burst of yellow-green flames.

A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spray forms a line 10 feet long and 5 feet wide. The first creature in the line must make a successful DC 24 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected by Mechuiti's Ichor disease. The creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must make a successful DC 24 Constitution saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.\n\nInnate Spellcasting: \nmechuiti's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). Mechuiti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nat will: dispel magic, fireball, hold monster, wall of fire\n\n3/day each: fire storm, power word stun\n\n1/day each: meteor swarm, power word kill\n\nSpeak with Apes: \nMechuiti can communicate simple concepts to apes.\n\nMechuiti's Lair: \non initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mechuiti takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Mechuiti can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n\n- Mechuiti targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it, and a fissure full of lava opens under the target\u2019s feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) fire damage.\n\n- The whole volcano trembles and shakes. Each creature on a solid surface other than a demon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. All ground in the volcano becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than a demon until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\n- Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.\n\n- The pain of all creatures other than demons within 120 feet of Mechuiti is intensified. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, every time a creature affected this way takes damage, he must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing Mechuiti\u2019s lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects.\n\n- Mechuiti can make the volcano erupt at will. A cloud of hot ashes and smoke covers a 6 mile area around the volcano, and magma flows from the volcano\u2019s cone.\n\n- When intelligent creatures within 6 miles sleep, they dream with Mechuiti. Unless they make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, they are compelled to seek out and join Mechuiti\u2019s cult.\n\n- Water within 1 mile of the lair carries Mechuiti\u2019s Ichor disease. Any creature that drinks the water must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or be infected. An infected creature is poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (2d4). The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target\u2019s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.\n\nwhen Mechuiti dies, all these regional effects fade immediately.\n\n",

For each mordant puppet that would have been affected by the turning if it were a zombie, the mordant snare gains 10 temporary hit points, to a maximum of 60.\n\nBuried: \nUntil it does something to reveal its presence, a buried mordant snare is treated as if it's invisible.\n\nMordant Puppets: \nA mordant snare can control up to four bodies per tentacle. These \"puppets\"look and move like zombies. Treat each one as a zombie, but limited in movement to the 30-foot-by-30-foot area above the buried snare. Unlike normal zombies, any creature within 5 feet of a mordant puppet when the puppet takes piercing or slashing damage takes 3 (1d6) acid damage (spray from the wound). All puppets attached to a particular tentacle are destroyed if the mordant snare attacks with that tentacle; this does 9 (2d8) acid damage per puppet to all creatures within 5 feet of any of those puppets, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Damage done to puppet zombies doesn't affect the mordant snare. If the snare is killed, all of its puppets die immediately without causing any acid damage.\n\n",

A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n\u2022 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n\u2022 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\u2022 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n\u2022 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n\u2022 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n\u2022 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n",

All bright light sources in the lair shed only dim light to their normal bright light radius, and dim light sources are extinguished. This lasts until the Queen dismisses the effect or dies.\n\n- An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. Each creature in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. Creatures in the wall\u2019s space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall\u2019s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semimaterial shadow resists intrusion. For every foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, any creature that, during its own turn, occupies any part of the wall\u2019s space takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, or until she dies.\n\n- The Queen targets one creature within 60 feet of her and assails its mind with visions of hopelessness and despair. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n\nRegional Effects: \nthe region containing the Queen of Night and Magic\u2019s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Shadows come to life within 6 miles of the Queen\u2019s lair. Most of the time these living shadows are unnerving and nothing more, but when a creature acts against the interests of the Queen, the shadows can interfere and cause any relevant die roll to be made with disadvantage.\n\n- Magic saturates the area within 6 miles of the lair, causing minor random effects similar to a prestidigitation cantrip.\n\n- The Queen of Night and Magic can cast her senses to any area containing darkness, dim light, or shadows within 6 miles of her lair, similar to a clairvoyance spell.\n\nwhile the Summer Court rules, the regional effects of the Queen\u2019s lair extend into the Winter Palace, but they are diminished and weaker than normal. During the Winter Court\u2019s reign, the Winter Palace is not subject to the regional effects. If the Queen of Night and Magic dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair gradually return to normal over the course of 2d10 days.\n\n",

She may visit the supplicant and hear a request, especially if the request is repeated on multiple nights. For 24 hours after the invocation, Nicenvin has a connection to the area that allows her to target it with teleportation circle.\n\n- Despite the weather, the moon is always visible for most of the night within 10 miles of the lair. Cloud cover has many breaks, or the moon\u2019s light sharply penetrates the clouds.\n\n- Silvery fog is common within 10 miles of the lair, and strange whispers are heard within the mist.\n\nif Nicnevin dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.\n\n",

The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.\n\nHag Coven: \nWhen hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\nShared Spellcasting (Coven Only): \nWhile all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n\u2022 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\n\u2022 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\n\u2022 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\n\u2022 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\n\u2022 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\n\u2022 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\n\nHag Eye (Coven Only): \nA hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n",

A creature that can hear this cacophony at the start of its turn and is within 120 feet of a shoggoth must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be confused (as the spell confusion) for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that roll a natural 20 on this saving throw become immune to the Hideous Piping for 24 hours. Otherwise, characters who meet the conditions must repeat the saving throw every round.\n\nKeen Senses: \nA shoggoth has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.\n\nRolling Charge: \nIf the shoggoth moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If the creature is knocked prone, the shoggoth immediately moves into the creature's space as a bonus action and crushes the creature beneath its bulk. The crushed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the shoggoth's turns. A crushed creature remains in its space and does not move with the shoggoth. A crushed creature can escape by using an action and making a successful DC 19 Strength check.

The golem's body glows when it absorbs a spell, as if under the effect of a light spell. A smaragdine golem can only hold one absorbed spell at a time.\n\n",

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\n\nEtherealness: \nThe fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.\n\n",

The target must make a successful DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or receive a devil's mark: a tattoo in the shape of Totivillus's personal seal. All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil.marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed by remove curse if the caster also makes a successful DC 23 spellcasting check. The mark reveals itself as desecrated to detect evil and good. It often shifts its position on the body, especially when it's concealed (and usually at the most inconvenient moment). Because such marks are sometimes placed on those who've made pacts with devils, NPC paladins and clerics might assume that any character bearing a devil's mark is in league with evil forces.\n\nCast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions): \nTotivillus casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.\n\n",

Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.\nEach time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\n\nChildren of the Night (1/Day): \nThe vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.\n\n",

Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant or fire damage.\n\nLight of Dawn (Recharges after a Long Rest): \nThe zoryas\u2019 lantern brightens, bathing its environs in brilliant light. Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. An undead creature who fails this save also takes 13 (3d8) fire damage. The light dispels up to three spells or other magical effects of 3rd level or lower like the dispel magic spell within the area.\n\nDusk\u2019s Arrival (Recharges after a Long Rest): \nThe zoryas\u2019 lantern darkens, snuffing out nearby natural and magical sources of light. Each creature within 30 feet of the zoryas must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is bathed in darkness like the darkness spell until the end of the zoryas\u2019 next turn.\n\n",

        "monster_sAblt": "Fire and Light: \nThe zoryas\u2019 weapon attacks are magical. When the zoryas hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant or fire damage (included in the attack). The zoryas chooses whether its attack does radiant or fire damage before making the attack roll.\n\nOpen Celestial Gate: \nAs an action, the zoryas opens a gateway to the celestial plane. The gate appears as a shimmering circle that sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet and is framed by twisting, golden strands. The gate lasts 1 hour; though, the zoryas can choose to close it at any time as a bonus action. Once the gate closes, the zoryas is reduced to 0 hp and remains unconscious for six days, awakening, fully restored, at sunrise on the seventh day. The zoryas can\u2019t pass through its own gate.\n\nRegeneration: \nThe zoryas regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If the zoryas takes necrotic damage, this trait doesn\u2019t function at the start of the zoryas\u2019 next turn. The zoryas\u2019 body is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn\u2019t regenerate.\n\nSun\u2019s Guidance (3/Day): \nThe zoryas has advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn.\n\n",
